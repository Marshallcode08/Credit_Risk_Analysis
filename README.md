Models


# Overview of the Analysis

    The purpose of this analysis is for us to show our ability to use machine learning and various models to predict an outcome. In this case we are trying to predict whether an individual based on data is high risk or low risk. applicant. From that we can determione to approve a loan or not.
    
# Results

From the data it shows that there is a much higher chance from the data that applicants are low risk rather than high risk.

Using SMOTE Oversampling show a 50/50 chance of an applicant being high or low risk.

The cluster undersampling method shows the same 50/50 chances looking at a smaller sample size.

This method is combination of the other two models, which shows high risk has a high chnace then lower but the data set is small difference.

The accuracy score shows 65% chance.

Balanced Accuracy shows 92%.

# Summary 

  The model would show that most applicants are low risk and should be approved for the loan given the variables of the test/models. Looking at some of the test like the balance accuracy it says that over 90% of applicants are low credit risk, but it seems that the variable of these test are more correlations and strong enough data to give a causation. There should be more test to ensure that the models are giving strong prediction that will help credit risk analysis to decern whether applicants are high or low risk.
